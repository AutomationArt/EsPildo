# EsPildo7 for Automation.art
It's a PCB learning board, but perhaps countering the cybersex corporations destroying at various stages all OpenSource product endeavors in this area.

#### Right away about bugs that were fixed in the scheme after the first prototype) 
!The board is still on order but everything will work

###  How does it work?
You write program code and upload it to the device controlling the whole periphery, developing imagination and algorithms of work. As an example, you can refer to the https://buttplug.io patterns to get more into it.
